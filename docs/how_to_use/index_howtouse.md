# How to use Search Exam software

Please download and open the software as explained in the [download](../download) section.


Once you open the software, it takes a few minutes to load for initially. It is actually working in the background even if it may appear stuck. Please be patient till you see the welcome screen like this.

### Windows protected screen
When you open the program for the very first time, you may see this blue screen “Windows protected your PC” which means that Windows didn’t recognize this software. **If** you see this screen, click on <span style="color:blue">More Info</span>  and then click on <span style="color:blue">Run Anyway</span>.
