# How to use Search Exam software

Please download and open the software as explained in the [download](../download) section.


Once you open the software, it takes a few minutes to load initially. It is actually working in the background even if it may appear stuck. Please be patient till you see the welcome screen like this.
(If you can't read the image, right click on it and open it in new tab).

### Windows protected screen
When you open the program for the very first time, you may see this blue screen “Windows protected your PC” which means that Windows didn’t recognize this software. **If** you see this screen, click on <span style="color:blue">More Info</span>  and then click on <span style="color:blue">Run Anyway</span>.

### Input questions

Software will ask you to input some parameters like start date, end date, location of exam center etc. This is similar to how you select the start date, end date and location on the Prometric website.

However, you use the mouse on the website, but here you have to write the inputs with keyboard and press the enter key.


For example, it will ask you about the exam for which you want the dates.
